# algorithmacy-lab

An open computational lab that applies **exact integrated information** (Φ, from IIT 4.0, computed with
[PyPhi](https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi)) to **organizational coordination theory**, and runs an
**AI-assisted research protocol** that takes a question to a finished quantitative paper.

The thesis it tests: a coordination form is **dyadic** when its cause-effect structure factors into
independent pieces (it demands *literacy*), and **triadic** when the structure stays irreducible across
the worker–system–counterpart partition (it demands *algorithmacy*). On systems small enough to compute
exact Φ, that verdict is exact, not a proxy.

## The empirical ask — bring the lab real data

Every result here is in-silico or pre-fieldwork, and the validation gap is the program's largest open
need. Closing it is community work: each of the four empirical arms below is waiting on a different kind of
real data, and the highest-value contribution available is to go get one piece of it. Bring it through a
pull request into `contrib` (see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)); the lab is reproducibility-first
and fixes its claims before computing, so a contributor commits the questions before the data.

- **Field — one real arrangement, modeled to a Φ verdict.** No real worker, platform, or message
  has been measured. The [field protocol](org_frontier/field/PROTOCOL.md) needs one real coordination — a
  team, the system that mediates it, the counterpart — with the determination rules (what each party's
  next action depends on, who reads whom) elicited from interviews, observation, or system documentation,
  and a second coder's agreement on the encoding. That turns a real arrangement into a Boolean model and
  an exact-Φ verdict. This is the deepest gap.
- **Qualitative — one worked study, run as fieldwork.** The studies under
  [`org_frontier/qualitative/`](org_frontier/qualitative/) are designs awaiting data: a neonatal bedside,
  a content-moderation team, a clinical handoff, a brokered market, each read against a named prior. Each
  needs access to the setting and the interviews, observation hours, and documents to read it. Run one,
  hold the prior open, and report where the real setting departs from the catalog's expectation.
- **Recurrence — one recorded series the lab has not touched.** The behavioral instrument has read
  open-source merge graphs ([v8–v10](org_frontier/recurrence/)) and wants more, ideally where the
  determination actor is recorded so both Φ and cross-recurrence can run: a bot-merged project, a dispatch
  or handoff log with a named gatekeeper, or a physiological series such as the infant vitals the neonatal
  study describes.
- **Survey — field the instrument with a real cohort.** The
  [survey arm](org_frontier/survey/) measures the competence directly: self-report from people inside a
  real coordination arrangement, on a fixed schedule, the questions committed before the answers. The
  pre-registered panel needs a cohort and the access to run it; any workforce coordinating through a
  system beyond its control is a candidate.

Each ask now has a ready-to-run **handoff packet** — a front-door README, the pre-registration discipline,
and a runnable scaffold that takes a real input to a verdict. The five are indexed in
[`org_frontier/HANDOFF_PACKETS.md`](org_frontier/HANDOFF_PACKETS.md). Each program README carries the
specifics, and the [overview](OVERVIEW.md) lists the open contributions in order of value. Dig as deep as
you like from there.

## The programs

The lab runs a computational program and five arms that carry it onto real coordination and into cognitive
theory. Each is a different lens on the same coordination arrangement.

- **The computational program** in [`org_frontier/`](org_frontier/) computes exact Φ on Boolean
  models through a fixed six-stage protocol — review → deep research → five hypotheses fixed before
  computing → methods → run against the exact-Φ instrument → paper. Its corpus of threads, studies,
  and questions stands as a catalog of pre-disclosed priors: the structural reading of what a
  coordination form is.
- **The field program** in [`org_frontier/field/`](org_frontier/field/) takes one real coordination
  arrangement through a nine-step protocol to a dyadic or triadic verdict on an explicit model of it. It is
  the bridge from the in-silico priors to a real case, where the determination rules are elicited from
  interviews, observation, and documents.
- **The qualitative program** in [`org_frontier/qualitative/`](org_frontier/qualitative/) reads real
  coordination settings against those priors, on the questions of process and meaning that fieldwork
  answers and a model cannot. It holds each prior open, and builds its contribution where a real
  setting departs from the catalog's expectation.
- **The recurrence program** in [`org_frontier/recurrence/`](org_frontier/recurrence/) pairs Φ with
  cross-recurrence quantification, the behavioral reading of how the parties' states track each other
  over time. Φ says whether a coordination is irreducible; cross-recurrence says how its signal
  moves, and which party leads.
- **The survey program** in [`org_frontier/survey/`](org_frontier/survey/) measures the competence in
  people: a human-subjects arm that reads algorithmacy as a lived skill through self-report from workers
  inside a real coordination arrangement, the measurement side of the validation gap the structural arms
  cannot reach.
- **The cognition program** in [`org_frontier/cognition/`](org_frontier/cognition/) is the formal bridge to
  the cognitive theories of coordination. Each theory of mind models a channel between two parties and has
  nowhere to put an opaque, interested third; the major complex holds that third as a member of the
  irreducible core, and each failure point becomes a computable Φ prediction.

Four readings meet on one arrangement: structure, fieldwork, behavior, and measurement. The field protocol
turns real evidence into the structural reading, and the cognition program ties that structure back to the
theories of mind it answers. Φ is the structural instrument the field, qualitative, and recurrence arms are
built around, and the survey arm measures the competence the structure is meant to demand. The
measure-validation arc in [`foundations/`](foundations/) established exact Φ first. The directory below is a
live map of the lab, regenerated from the content on every merge, so it is always current.

## Setup

Requires Python ≥ 3.10 and PyPhi's IIT-4.0 line.

```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run an org_frontier probe, or a foundations experiment, from the repo root:

```bash
python -m org_frontier.probes.probe_conjunctive_law          # a lab probe
python -m foundations.proxy_audit.run 15 1 && python -m foundations.proxy_audit.analyze
```

**New here and want to contribute an experiment?** [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](GETTING_STARTED.md)
walks the whole path by hand — environment, the instrument-validation gate, the model in one
paragraph, scaffolding a new question with `python -m org_frontier.protocol.new_question`,
registering numbers for CI, and opening the pull request.

## The writing skill

[`sentence-by-sentence/`](sentence-by-sentence/) is the lab's writing arm, packaged as a Claude Code
skill anyone can install. It rebuilds a manuscript one sentence at a time against a published model
paper — by reading rather than by measuring, with no code in it at all.

It was built after a pass that failed, and every rule in it comes from something that went wrong. A
manuscript was rewritten "sentence by sentence" against one exemplar: seven scripts were built, five
defects were found in the instruments, paragraph cohesion improved measurably — and the per-sentence
judgment columns were empty in all 617 rows. The defect that exposed it had been scored *good* by the
cohesion script, because it wore the shape the metric rewards.

The skill requires a model paper and a draft, and refuses to start without both. See its
[README](sentence-by-sentence/README.md) for the rules and what five independent test runs found.

## Repository note

This working tree also contains a separate, private dissertation repository nested at `dissertation/`,
gitignored and invisible to this repo. Where you run git from decides which remote you touch. See
[`REPO_LAYOUT.md`](REPO_LAYOUT.md) before committing.

## License and citation

## Contributing and publishing

Contributions are welcome, and the record is meant to grow by them. [`PUBLISHING.md`](PUBLISHING.md)
describes how to publish an essay or a study here: fork, open a pull request into the `contrib` branch,
pass a reproducibility-first public review, and get merged. Both `contrib` and `main` are branch-protected;
every change is a pull request, the `reproduce-the-numbers` workflow re-derives each registered number,
and a merge needs one approving review. The aspiration is a community of maintainers who sign off on
submissions in a peer review that is reproducible by construction. To join that review board — the
reviewers and editors — apply through the `maintainer-applications` branch; see
[`MAINTAINERS.md`](MAINTAINERS.md). Code and probe conventions are in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## For AI agents and LLM tools

Three files serve agents, by purpose:

- **[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)** — the operating manual for an agent working *in* the repo: the map, the
  run and verify commands, the two-repo git rule, the land flow, and the definition-of-done checklist.
  Nested `AGENTS.md` files cover the subtrees with their own workflow.
- **[`MAP.md`](MAP.md)** — a generated one-screen index of the entry documents, programs, machinery, and
  live counts. Load it instead of crawling the tree.
- **[`llms.txt`](llms.txt)** — a token-light brief for *describing* the project to outside users: a
  canonical summary safe to copy into memory, framing rules, and links to the key documents.
